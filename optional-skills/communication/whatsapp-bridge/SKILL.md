# WhatsApp Bridge

Wire WhatsApp into the existing chat interface as one more channel adapter. The
framework already abstracts Telegram/Slack/Discord (see `.claude/sections/02_*`);
this adds a WhatsApp adapter behind the same interface — it does not fork the
engine.

## Provider

Use the WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta) or an equivalent gateway (e.g. Twilio for
WhatsApp). Both deliver inbound messages via webhook and accept outbound sends
via REST.

Required `.env` values:

```
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=          # for webhook handshake
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS=       # comma-separated allowlist
```

## Adapter contract

Implement the channel adapter to match the existing chat interface:

1. **Inbound** — verify the webhook signature, drop senders not in
   `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS`, normalize the payload to the engine's message
   shape, and hand it to the router.
2. **Outbound** — render the engine's reply to WhatsApp's message format and POST
   it to the Cloud API.

## Security

- Enforce `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` on every inbound message — mirror the
  `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` allowlist pattern. Unknown senders are dropped, not
  answered.
- Outbound sends are mutations: route them through the `chat.send` capability
  gate with an audit trail. Never call the WhatsApp API directly from a tool.
- Verify the webhook `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC before trusting any payload.
