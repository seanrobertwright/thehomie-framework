# Heartbeat Monitor

Check that the running stack is healthy and report a single green/red verdict.

## What to probe

The framework runs a local API on port 4322 (see
`.claude/sections/03_*` / orchestration). Probe the pieces that matter:

| Component | Probe |
|-----------|-------|
| Local API | `GET http://127.0.0.1:4322/health` returns 200 |
| Chat process | process for `run_chat.sh` is alive |
| Memory heartbeat | last heartbeat timestamp is < 2× the interval old |
| Disk | vault partition has free space |

## Run

```bash
bash optional-skills/devops/heartbeat-monitor/scripts/healthcheck.sh
# exit 0 = all green, exit 1 = something is down
```

The script prints a per-check table and sets a non-zero exit code on any
failure, so it composes with cron / CI / an external uptime service.

## Escalation

- For local use, surface the red verdict in chat.
- For unattended monitoring, point an **external** uptime service (Healthchecks.io,
  UptimeRobot, a cron on another host) at this script or at the `/health` route —
  a monitor running inside the same process it watches can't report its own
  death.
- This skill only reads state; it does not restart anything. Pair with
  `log-triage` to explain *why* a check went red.
