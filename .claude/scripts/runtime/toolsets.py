"""Static toolset registry — Hermes shape (dict-of-dicts, not dataclass).

Auto-discovery extension: toolsets carrying ``live_source`` and ``live_filter``
resolve their contents at every ``resolve_toolset()`` call via
``list_capabilities()``. No cache — the registry captures structural intent
only; the actual tools come from the live aggregator surface.

The static dict literal below is the single source of truth for toolset
structure. There is no build function, no cache variable, and no refresh API.
This is the Hermes-faithful pivot: data-shape parity with
``hermes-agent/toolsets.py`` (lines 68+ for the literal, lines 504-554 for the
resolver). The single deviation is the optional ``live_source`` /
``live_filter`` pair, which generalizes Hermes' own plugin late-lookup pattern
(``get_toolset()`` lines 472-501) for The Homie's adopter story.

Modules in this package never import from ``runtime.capabilities`` here at
load time — both modules late-import each other inside functions, so this file
remains a leaf module.
