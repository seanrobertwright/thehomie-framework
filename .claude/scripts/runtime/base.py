    This is the ONLY definition of "a tool turn" for routing purposes, and it

    The distinction matters. `TOOL_REASONING` means "this request may use
    tools", which for the CLI lanes means *their own* shell and edit tools —
    Codex and Gemini both serve those turns perfectly well and must keep doing
    so. Keying the routing exclusion off the capability tier instead would
    strip both CLI lanes from every existing tool turn in the framework and
    collapse the fallback chain to Claude alone, which is the exact failure
    this epic exists to prevent, inverted.

    Uses an explicit length check rather than truthiness: a list SUBCLASS may
    override ``__bool__`` and report falsey while holding entries, which would
    classify a genuine tool turn as a plain one and route it to a lane that

    THE BYPASS THIS CLOSES (adversarial review, Codex — BLOCKER):
    ``tool_registry`` enforces "all tools must be part of a toolset to be
    accessible" by only ever emitting names a toolset resolved to. But
    ``tool_defs`` is a plain ``list[dict]`` on the request, so any caller could
    hand-assemble a schema for an unregistered — or deliberately out-of-scope —
    tool and hand it straight to a provider, walking around the registry
    entirely. Correct assembly in the persona layer would then be *convention*,
    not "default-deny by construction", and the difference between those two is
    the whole security model.

    So provenance is checked HERE, at the runtime boundary every lane crosses,
    rather than trusting each caller to have used the registry.

    What this does and does not prove:

    * It proves every carried name is REGISTERED. That is a provenance check.
    * It does NOT prove the name is in scope for a particular persona — the
      request does not carry a persona identity, and inventing one here would
      duplicate scoping logic that belongs in the assembly layer (#244).
      Scope stays where the toolsets are resolved; this is the backstop that
      makes an unregistered tool unreachable no matter who assembled it.

    Fails OPEN only when the registry module itself is unavailable (an adopter
    running the runtime slice without the registry). It never fails open on a
    name it could not find — that is the case it exists to catch.
