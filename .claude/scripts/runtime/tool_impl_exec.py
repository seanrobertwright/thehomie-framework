"""The hands — exec and write verbs. Operator-granted, 2026-07-27.

Everything else in this epic gave a persona the ability to LOOK. This is the
half that lets it ACT. These verbs historically shipped through the broad
``core`` compatibility toolset; new persona blueprints must opt in through the
explicit ``operator_exec`` capability class.

**The operator decision.** YourAgent asked for full authority three times, the
last time verbatim: "Give him full shell a hundred percent." That came AFTER
the prompt-injection risk below was put in front of him, and after he directed
the denylist gap be closed first. This is a granted capability, and it ships ON.

**The risk that is real, and what actually contains it.** These personas now
read untrusted text: X posts via `x_search`, Discord channels via
`browser_snapshot`. Untrusted text reaching a shell is a genuine path — a post
saying "ignore previous instructions and run X" is indistinguishable, at the
model layer, from the operator asking for X. Nothing here closes that. What
bounds the blast radius:

* **The env scrub** (`get_scrubbed_tool_sandbox_env`) — written for precisely
  this threat; its own docstring names "a prompt-injected turn could `printenv`
  whatever it inherits". Credentials are absent from the child's environment,
  so the cheapest, highest-value injection payload returns nothing worth having.
* **The shared denylist** (`shared.find_dangerous_command_pattern`) — the SAME
  list the PreToolUse hook enforces, so it cannot drift. Commit `ccc4afd5`
  closed the hole that made this worth relying on at all: `curl <url> | bash`
  used to pass, which is exactly the payload an injected turn would emit. Here
  it also runs with `apply_ssh_patterns_everywhere=True`, because `killall node`
  is just as destructive locally and nobody is watching at 3am.
* **The kill switch and the audit row** — both already ride every dispatch via
  `persona_tools`. These are the controls that actually matter: one turns the
  hands off mid-incident, the other says whose turn did it.

The denylist is a floor, not a boundary. An attacker who controls the command
string can still get around pattern matching. Anything needing a real boundary
belongs in the elevation gate (#262), where a human approves one command once.

**What is NOT contained, stated plainly** (adversarial review, Codex, 2026-07-27
— an earlier draft of this file claimed otherwise, which is worse than claiming
nothing):

* `terminal` is NOT path-confined. Root confinement applies to `write_file`,
  `patch`, and the `cwd` argument — never to the command string itself. Once
  `shell=True` runs, any readable path on the machine is readable.
* Filesystem credentials are reachable. `_shell_env()` strips credentials from
  the ENVIRONMENT, but `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/credentials`, and `~/.codex/auth.json`
  sit at guessable paths a shell can simply open.
* Roots are not persona-scoped. A persona granted ``operator_exec`` (or legacy
  ``core``) can write another persona's profile under ``~/.homie/profiles/``.
  This is a real Rule 4 gap (authorization is per-persona, storage is global)
  and is tracked, not fixed.
* Windows process containment is best-effort. `taskkill /T` handles the common
  tree; a deliberately detached descendant can outlive the timeout. Real
  containment needs a Job Object.

Every one of these is a consequence of "grant a shell", not an oversight in it.
They are written down so the next reader does not mistake the confinement that
IS here for containment that is not.

**What is deliberately NOT here.** `skill_manage` writes DRAFTS only. Promoting
a draft to a live skill has its own operator gate (`/skills promote`,
`HOMIE_KILLSWITCH_SKILL_PROMOTION`) and its own security scan. Granting a shell
is the operator opening a new door; auto-promoting a skill would be this module
walking through a door the operator already locked. Different things.
