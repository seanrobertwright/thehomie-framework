"""
Weekly Synthesis Script for The Homie

Reviews the last 7 days of daily logs and creates a weekly summary in
vault/memory/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md. Also updates MEMORY.md and GOALS.md
status fields. Runs Sunday 8 PM via OS scheduler.

Usage:
    uv run python memory_weekly.py              # Run weekly synthesis
    uv run python memory_weekly.py --test       # Dry run (no file edits)
    uv run python memory_weekly.py --days 14    # Two-week lookback

## Instructions

Perform these steps:

### 1. Create Weekly Summary
Create the file `{weekly_path}` with these sections:
- **What Moved Forward** — projects, features, or decisions that progressed
- **What Stalled** — things that were blocked, delayed, or abandoned
- **Recurring Patterns** — habits, workflows, or issues that appeared multiple times
- **Key Decisions** — important choices made during the week
- **Lessons Learned** — new insights or mistakes to remember
- **Goals Progress** — how each goal in GOALS.md progressed this week

### 2. Update MEMORY.md ({MEMORY_FILE})
If daily reflection missed any important items, add them now.
Remove outdated entries that are no longer relevant.

### 3. Update GOALS.md ({GOALS_FILE})
Update the **Status** field for each goal based on this week's progress.
Keep status updates concise (1-2 sentences).
If a goal needs new key metrics or active projects, update those too.

### 4. Log Summary
Append a brief summary (2-3 sentences) to today's daily log ({get_today_log_path()}).

### 5. Update SELF.md ({SELF_FILE})
Distill this week's Lessons Learned into the four sections.
Only update a section if there is clear, new evidence. Do NOT duplicate existing entries.

- **Capabilities** — A new tool, method, or integration confirmed to work this week
- **Patterns** — A recurring successful approach that appeared 2+ times
- **Failure Modes** — A mistake or struggle from Lessons Learned or What Stalled
- **Confidence Notes** — An assumption corrected, or a recurring area of uncertainty
- **System Observations** — A meta-observation about the framework's own improvement process (e.g., a gap discovered and fixed, a pipeline that proved its value, a feedback loop that worked or failed)

1-2 sentences per entry. If nothing new, skip this step entirely.

### 6. Cross-Domain Aha Moments
Add a `## Aha Moments` section to the weekly file (after `## Key Decisions`, before `## Lessons Learned`).

This is the most important section. Step back from the week's activity and ask:
- Where is **effort concentrated** vs. where is **risk concentrated**? Are they aligned?
- What decision made in one domain (coding, business, finance, personal) creates **unrecognized risk or opportunity** in another?
- What has been **silent for too long** that now has new context from this week?
- What **pattern is accelerating** that nobody named yet?
- What would a smart outside observer say owner is missing by looking at all of this together?

Write 3-5 specific, evidence-backed aha moments. Each one must:
- Name the **two or more domains it spans** (e.g., "YourBusiness × Finance", "Framework build × YourBusiness dark")
- State the insight in 2-3 sentences
- Cite a specific date, event, commit, or log entry as evidence
- Avoid generic observations — only include things that are non-obvious from looking at one domain in isolation

If there is no real cross-domain signal this week, write: `No cross-domain signal detected this week.`

**Rules:**
- Use the Edit tool to update existing files, Write tool only for the new weekly file
- Do NOT duplicate items already present in MEMORY.md
- Keep entries concise and actionable
- Reference specific dates and events from the logs
- If nothing meaningful happened this week, respond with exactly: WEEKLY_OK
