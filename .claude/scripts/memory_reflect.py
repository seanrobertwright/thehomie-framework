# WORK-NOTE DISTILLATION — Spike-1 hybrid (issue #425 reconcile)
# =============================================================================
#
# The architecture doc's Spike-1 decision rule: "works -> Route A ships. SDK
# tools misbehave under the profile root -> Route B ... with a deterministic
# MEMORY.md render of promoted beliefs as follow-up." The gate proved the
# failure mode — Route A's tool-enabled agent (Edit/Bash, acceptEdits,
# cwd=PROJECT_ROOT) can be steered by a hostile note to write OUTSIDE the
# persona's own MEMORY_DIR, because PROJECT_ROOT is fixed at the repo root
# and never re-roots per profile the way MEMORY_DIR does.
#
# The hybrid closes that escape by construction instead of falling all the
# way back to Route B: the notes corpus (discovery, injection screen, caps)
# is UNCHANGED, but the LLM leg becomes a NO-TOOLS structured-output call
# built with the framework's zero-tool contract — ``model_only=True`` plus
# ``disallowed_tools=["*"]`` via ``secure_curriculum_request``, ``cwd`` at the
# persona's own profile root (see ``build_persona_notes_request`` for why
# ``allowed_tools=[]`` alone would NOT have been confinement). The model can
# only return JSON amendment candidates in its final message; it has no Edit
# or Bash tool to escape with. The HOST then applies those candidates through
# the EXISTING, already-confined amendment ledger
# (``cognition.amendments._confined_amendment_target`` resolves every write
# strictly under the ``memory_dir`` argument — never PROJECT_ROOT, never an
# ambient path), so the distilled lesson still lands in the persona's own

    """Distil the persona's own work-note corpus into its MEMORY.md.

    NO tools reach the model — this is the whole point, and it is enforced at
    the REQUEST layer by ``build_persona_notes_request`` (``model_only=True``
    plus the ``disallowed_tools=["*"]`` deny marker, ``cwd`` at the persona's
    own profile root). There is no Edit or Bash tool for a hostile note to
    steer, regardless of what the note's content instructs, and the lane router
    refuses any adapter that cannot prove it removes the whole tool surface.
    The model's ONLY output channel is its final message text, parsed here as
    amendment JSON records.

    Every returned proposal's ``source`` is HOST-FORCED to
    ``NOTES_DISTILL_SOURCE`` by ``parse_amendment_records`` regardless of
    what the model returns (the Act-5 invariant — a persona-note proposal
    can never mint a non-reflection provenance). The apply path
    (``process_amendment_output`` -> ``apply_amendment_if_allowed`` ->
    ``_confined_amendment_target``) is the SAME confined path
    ``_run_reflection_inner``'s own daily-log amendments already use —
    resolved strictly under ``memory_dir`` — narrowed for this source by
    ``NOTES_DISTILL_POLICY`` to MEMORY.md alone, so a steered proposal cannot
    reach the persona's SOUL.md/SELF.md/USER.md. The allowlist is keyed by
    source, so pending rows from OTHER producers that this drain-the-ledger
    apply pass also sees are evaluated exactly as before.

    ``test_mode`` runs the SAME reasoning call (so the operator sees the
    candidate count) but never touches the ledger or MEMORY.md — a dry run
    must not advance the ledger or mutate profile artifacts.

    ``ledger_file`` is a ``None`` sentinel resolved to
    ``AMENDMENT_LEDGER_FILE`` at call time (Rule 1).

    Fail-open for the RUN, fail-HONEST to the parent. Every failure below
    returns a receipt (the daily-log leg and the chat-corpus pass must still
    run) but stamps ``status="failed"``, which `_run_reflection_inner` folds
    into `_NOTES_LEG_FAILED` and `main()` turns into a non-zero exit — so the
    learning tick does NOT advance its boundary past notes that were never
    distilled.

    ``KillSwitchDisabled`` is the one exception: it PROPAGATES. An operator
    switching the LLM off is not a distillation failure to absorb, it is an
    instruction, and the house rule is that this exception is never swallowed.
    It also reaches the parent as a non-zero exit through ``__main__``.

## Recent Daily Logs

{log_context}
{recalled_section}
## Instructions

Review the daily logs carefully and propose durable memory updates as needed:

### 1. MEMORY.md ({MEMORY_FILE})
Propose important items:
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Lessons learned or mistakes
- Important facts or configurations
- Project status updates
- Upcoming events needing preparation

### 2. USER.md ({USER_FILE})
Propose an update when you notice patterns about {OWNER_NAME or "the user"}:
- Communication preferences (how they like to interact)
- Schedule patterns (when they work, meeting patterns, creative time)
- Content preferences (what topics, formats, or styles they gravitate toward)
- Tool/workflow preferences (what they use, how they like things done)
- Team updates (new collaborators, role changes)
- New integrations or account info

### 3. SOUL.md ({SOUL_FILE})
Propose an update ONLY if you see clear evidence of communication style adaptations:
- Tone preferences confirmed through repeated interactions
- Behavioral patterns that should be codified
- Changes to how the assistant should operate

### 4. SELF.md ({SELF_FILE})
Propose an update ONLY when you see clear evidence in the logs — require 2+ instances or an explicit lesson.
Do NOT propose for one-off mentions.

- **Capabilities** — A new tool or approach confirmed to work
- **Patterns** — A recurring successful behavior observed this week
- **Failure Modes** — A mistake that recurred in the logs
- **Confidence Notes** — An assumption corrected, or a known uncertain area

1-2 sentences per entry. If nothing meets the bar, skip the proposal.

{_assemble_reflect_repo_routing_section()}

**Rules:**
- Do not edit MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, or SELF.md directly
- Use the amendment proposal ledger for any change to those files
- You may edit existing repository pages under {MEMORY_DIR / "repositories"} for repo-scoped routing/activity updates
- You may append a concise run summary to today's daily log ({get_today_log_path()})
- Do NOT duplicate items already present in a file
- Keep entries concise
- Only update USER.md/SOUL.md when there is clear, repeated evidence (not one-off mentions)
- Log only what you proposed to today's daily log ({get_today_log_path()})

If nothing is worth updating in any file, respond with exactly: REFLECTION_OK
