"""External watchdog for The Homie bot — the watcher of last resort.

Why this exists
---------------
On 2026-07-12 the bot was found wedged for ~6 weeks. Nothing noticed, because
nothing was looking:

* ``service.py`` (retired 2026-07, archived) was crash-only — it waited on
  ``proc.wait()``, and a wedged process never returns.
* The Windows scheduled task restarts on process *exit*, which likewise never
  came.
* ``heartbeat.py`` checks calendar/email/Asana — never the bot.
* Nothing anywhere polled ``:{port}/health``.

The in-bot liveness supervisor (``chat/liveness.py``) now catches a dead adapter
and fails fast, but it cannot catch a bot that is hard-hung, OOM-killed, or dead
before its supervisor ever starts. That is this script's job: poll /health from
*outside* the process and restart the bot when it stops answering truthfully.

Together they cover the whole failure surface:

    dead adapter, process healthy  -> in-bot supervisor self-heals, else exits
    process hung / gone / never up -> this watchdog restarts it

Design
------
* **``--once`` is the default.** The scheduled task fires this every few minutes;
  consecutive-failure counting and the restart budget live in a state file, so a
  short-lived process still has memory across runs. No long-lived daemon to
  supervise (a watchdog that can itself wedge is not a watchdog).
* **Restart budget** — a rolling-hour cap (default 5, same policy as
  ``service.py``). Exhausting it notifies the operator and STOPS restarting; a
  restart loop is worse than a down bot because it hides the real cause.
* **Grace window** — after a restart, failures are not counted while the bot
  boots. Diagnostics warm-up used to take seconds; ``status: "warming"`` is
  explicitly tolerated inside the grace window.
* **Fail-safe classification** — only a PROVEN-bad reading (unreachable, or a
  ``degraded`` status / a ``false`` adapter) counts as a failure. Anything the
  watchdog cannot interpret is treated as OK, because a watchdog that restarts
  on its own confusion is a self-inflicted outage.

Usage
-----
    uv run python bot_watchdog.py                # one poll (scheduled task)
    uv run python bot_watchdog.py --dry-run      # classify only, never restart
    uv run python bot_watchdog.py --json         # machine-readable verdict
    uv run python bot_watchdog.py --daemon       # continuous polling (debug)
    uv run python bot_watchdog.py --status       # show state file, no poll
