"""Living Self Act 4 — the evolve-loop orchestrator + the missing propose() seam.

``evolve/regression.py:16`` and ``veto.py:20`` reference a ``propose()`` that was
NEVER built (grep ``def propose`` evolve/ -> zero non-comment hits). This module
BUILDS it (the recall ``propose`` subcommand) and ADDS the new ``propose-belief``
identity rail — the fitness oracle Archon calls.

TWO subcommands, both gated by ``EVOLVE_ENABLED`` at their entrypoint (m6):
  - ``propose`` (recall safe-first, the no-op-safe wake-the-loop proof): run
    ``run_replay`` over the baseline + a candidate override-set, ``compare_reports``,
    the EXISTING recall ``evaluate_regression_corpus``, ``evaluate_veto(delta,
    ruleset, regression_summary=...)``, ``write_decision_artifact``. NO identity
    mutation — recall params only. M3: replay over the EXACT ``regression_queries
    .json`` ``query`` list (via ``goldens.load_regression_queries``) so the
    per-query results are index-aligned with the regression entries
    (``evaluate_regression_corpus`` raises ``ValueError`` on length mismatch).
  - ``propose-belief`` (the identity rail): construct the ``AmendmentProposal``
    ONCE via ``_proposal_from`` (B1 — reuse the SAME instance for ``led.append`` +
    ``apply`` so the ledger row flips to ``applied``), run ``verify_evidence_support``
    (the confined evidence-READ + deterministic floor, incl. the candidate's own
    N1 ``prediction``), then ``judge_belief_candidate`` (the scheduled LLM judge),
    then ``_write_belief_decision`` (M1 — the SIBLING artifact, NOT
    ``write_decision_artifact`` which needs a recall ReportDelta that does not
    exist for a belief). On ADOPT AND not ``--dry-run``, route the WINNER through
    the UNCHANGED ledger with the SAME deterministic gate bound (defense-in-depth).

Boundary (vertical-slice): the candidate-SEARCH loop is Archon; the FITNESS ORACLE
(``evolve/``) + the STORE (the ledger + memory.db) are The Homie. This module is
the contract surface Archon calls (writes a candidate JSON, reads a decision
artifact). The bare cron runs the SAFE recall ``propose``; the belief rail is
Archon-driven (provider-quota discipline).

Rule 1 (call-time settings), Rule 2 (physical reads + atomic artifact), Rule 3
(the judge rides reasoning_step -> run_with_runtime_lanes), fail-open VISIBLE.
