Five automated pipelines keep memory current. All run through the runtime layer and live in `.claude/scripts/`.

### Heartbeat (Every 30 min)

Proactively checks calendar, email, Asana, and content deadlines. Sends desktop notifications when something needs attention.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `heartbeat.py` | Main script — gathers API data, runs runtime-backed reasoning |
| `config.py` | Path constants, active hours, timezone config |
| `notifications.py` | Cross-platform notifications (Windows toast / macOS osascript / Linux notify-send) |
| `shared.py` | State management, daily log helpers, file locking, bash validation |

**Flow:** OS scheduler → `uv run python heartbeat.py` → Python calls APIs → results fed into runtime prompt → runtime reasons → notification or `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

**Auth:** Default uses Claude Code CLI credentials (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`).
**State:** `.claude/data/state/heartbeat-state.json`
**Checklist:** `vault/memory/HEARTBEAT.md`

### Memory Search (On-demand)

Hybrid search (keyword + semantic) over all memory files. Fully local — no API calls.

1. Markdown files chunked into ~400-token overlapping segments
2. FTS5 keyword + sqlite-vec/pgvector semantic search
3. Embeddings via FastEmbed (ONNX, BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, 768-dim native)
4. Hybrid search: vector similarity (0.7) + keyword score (0.3)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `db.py` | Database abstraction — SQLiteMemoryDB or PostgresMemoryDB |
| `memory_index.py` | Chunks markdown, generates embeddings, stores via db.py |
| `memory_search.py` | Keyword/semantic/hybrid search with CLI |
| `embeddings.py` | FastEmbed wrapper with lazy model loading |

```bash
cd .claude/scripts && uv run python memory_search.py "query" --mode keyword --limit 5
cd .claude/scripts && uv run python memory_search.py "query" --mode hybrid --limit 10
cd .claude/scripts && uv run python memory_search.py "topic" --mode hybrid --path-prefix drafts/sent --limit 3
```

**Data:** `.claude/data/memory.db` (git-ignored, regenerable via `memory_index.py`). Model cache at `.claude/data/models/`.

### Proactive Memory Recall (Chat Engine)

When the Telegram bot receives a message (> 20 chars), `engine.py → _recall_memory()` runs FTS5 keyword search (~50ms) and injects top 3 results into the system prompt.

```env
RECALL_ENABLED=true          # Toggle recall on/off
RECALL_MIN_SCORE=0.3         # Minimum FTS5 score to include
RECALL_MAX_RESULTS=3         # Max snippets injected
RECALL_MIN_MSG_LEN=20        # Skip short messages ("hi", "thanks")
```

### Unified Recall Service

`recall_service.py` is the sole runtime entrypoint for all recall (Invariant I-3). Wraps `cognition.recall` with lazy Langfuse imports, graceful degradation if cognition modules are unavailable, and injection defense via `cognition.injection`. Used by: chat engine, heartbeat, reflection, weekly synthesis.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `recall_service.py` | Canonical recall interface — `recall(query, context)` → ranked snippets |
| `cognition/recall.py` | Core recall logic — tier classification, dual search, graph traversal, hub boosting |

### Identity Payload Consolidation

`cognition/identity_payload.py` is the canonical reader for identity-file context (SOUL / SELF / USER / MEMORY / GOALS / WORKING). The chat hot path and the cron memory pipelines share this single shim instead of duplicating `read_file_safe()` calls — preventing the "two parallel readers" drift class-of-bug when a new identity file gets added (e.g., a future HABITS.md only needs to be added to `DEFAULT_INCLUDE` and every consumer picks it up). PRD-8 Phase 2 (WS2 + WS3 + WS4).

```python
def build_identity_payload(
    memory_dir: Path,
    *,
    include: tuple[str, ...] | None = None,
) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Returns dict keyed by uppercase name. Missing files → key ABSENT."""
```

Fail-open contract (matches `read_file_safe`): missing files surface as absent keys (not empty string, not `None`); empty `memory_dir` → `{}`; OS errors swallowed by `read_file_safe` and never escape. Consumers keep their own prompt assembly, ordering, and headers — the shim only hands back raw content. No file-content caching at module scope (Rule 2); `include` is a `None` sentinel resolved inside the body (Rule 1).

| Consumer | Call site | What it consumes |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| `engine.py:182` | `_build_frozen_regions()` | SOUL / SELF / USER / MEMORY / WORKING — wired into `PromptRegion`s with `config.REGION_BUDGETS` (env-overridable, UNCHANGED). Interleaved `user_inferences` (between user_model and durable_memory) and `procedural_memory` (after working_memory) regions stay verbatim — the shim does NOT touch them. |
| `memory_reflect.py:202` | Daily reflection prompt prologue | MEMORY + USER + SOUL |
| `memory_weekly.py:188` | Weekly synthesis prompt prologue | MEMORY + USER + SOUL + GOALS |
| `memory_dream.py:321` | Dream consolidate phase | MEMORY + SELF + GOALS |
| `memory_dream.py:431` | Dream prune phase | MEMORY |

Parity tests prove byte-equality with the pre-refactor inline-read path: `tests/test_chat_runtime_engine.py::test_frozen_regions_parity_with_shim`, `tests/test_memory_reflect.py::test_prompt_parity_with_shim`, `tests/test_memory_weekly.py::test_prompt_parity_with_shim`, `tests/test_memory_dream.py::test_consolidate_prompt_parity_with_shim` + `::test_prune_prompt_parity_with_shim`.

### Entity Compilation Engine (Karpathy Port)

When a document is ingested, the compilation engine extracts key entities/concepts and creates or updates dedicated concept pages in `vault/memory/concepts/`. This turns the vault from a filing system into a deeply interlinked knowledge graph — ported from Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern.

**Concept pages** accumulate claims from multiple sources over time. Each ingest can touch 5-15 concept pages. Contradictions between sources are automatically flagged as Obsidian callout blocks.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `entity_extractor.py` | Core engine — extraction, compilation, contradiction detection, backfill, sweep, index, archive, CLI |
| `vault_lint.py` | 8 health checks — orphans, broken wikilinks, frontmatter, tags, stale content, page size, index, contradictions |
| `config.py` | `RECALL_RERANK_ENABLED`, `RECALL_RERANK_TOP_N`, `RECALL_RERANK_TIMEOUT_S` |
| `cognition/recall.py` | `_llm_rerank()` — haiku re-ranks top 10 results for Tier 1 queries |

**Compilation triggers (8 entry points):**

| Trigger | When | Automatic? |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `/vault-ingest` Step 3.5 | Ingest any doc | Manual |
| `/file` command | After a good bot answer | Manual (nudged) |
| `/file` nudge | After long analytical response (>800 chars + analysis signals) | Auto-suggested |
| Daily reflection hook | 8 AM daily (after `memory_reflect.py`) | Automatic |
| Weekly synthesis hook | Sunday 8 PM (after `memory_weekly.py`) | Automatic |
| Backfill | One-time bootstrap of all existing vault notes | Manual |
| Sweep | Find and compile notes without concept coverage | Schedulable |
| CLI direct | `entity_extractor.py compile/extract/contradictions` | Manual |

**CLI reference:**

```bash
# Extract entities from a source (prints JSON)
uv run python entity_extractor.py extract "path/to/source.md"

# Compile: extract entities + create/update concept pages
uv run python entity_extractor.py compile "path/to/source.md" --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Compile from pre-extracted entities (LLM-curated JSON)
uv run python entity_extractor.py compile "source.md" --entities entities.json --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Backfill: compile all uncompiled vault notes
uv run python entity_extractor.py backfill --vault-dir "vault/memory" --dry-run
uv run python entity_extractor.py backfill --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Sweep: compile only notes without concept coverage
uv run python entity_extractor.py sweep --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Check concept page for contradictions
uv run python entity_extractor.py contradictions "vault/memory/concepts/HERMES-AGENT.md"

# Generate/regenerate concepts/INDEX.md (grouped by entity type)
uv run python entity_extractor.py index --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Generate/regenerate root INDEX.md (whole-wiki catalog: identity + MOCs + concepts + dirs)
uv run python entity_extractor.py index-root --vault-dir "vault/memory"

# Preserve a source into raw/ as an immutable archive (Karpathy raw/ pattern)
uv run python entity_extractor.py preserve-raw "path/to/source.md" --vault-dir "vault/memory"
uv run python entity_extractor.py preserve-raw "statement.pdf" --vault-dir "finance-vault" --date-prefix

# Archive stale orphan concept pages to _archive/concepts/
uv run python entity_extractor.py archive --vault-dir "vault/memory" --dry-run
uv run python entity_extractor.py archive --vault-dir "vault/memory" --page "SOME-SLUG"
uv run python entity_extractor.py archive --vault-dir "vault/memory" --days 180

# Run vault health lint (8 checks, zero LLM cost)
uv run python vault_lint.py --vault-dir "vault/memory"
uv run python vault_lint.py --vault-dir "vault/memory" --check broken_wikilinks --check orphan_pages
uv run python vault_lint.py --vault-dir "vault/memory" --format json
```

**Vault artifacts (Karpathy LLM Wiki port):**
- `{vault}/INDEX.md` — whole-wiki catalog (auto-refreshed by `compile_entities()` + `index-root` CLI). Single first-read surface covering identity files, MOCs, concepts-by-type (capped at 25/type), and top-level directories.
- `{vault}/concepts/INDEX.md` — concept-only drill-down catalog.
- `{vault}/LOG.md` — append-only chronological timeline of wiki-evolution events (`ingest`, `compile`, `reflect`, `weekly`, `dream`, `archive`). Grep-friendly: `grep "^## \[" LOG.md | tail -5`. Heartbeat excluded (too noisy).
- `{vault}/raw/` — immutable original sources. Never modified. Preserved via `preserve_raw()` helper, invoked by `/vault-ingest` Step 2.5 and `finance_ingest.py`.

**Key design decisions:**
- Concept pages live in flat `vault/memory/concepts/` folder with `tags: [concept, auto-compiled]`
- Confidence threshold: 0.6 (extract up to 15, only compile those above threshold)
- Heuristic extraction (headings, bold, wikilinks, frontmatter) — no LLM API call. The vault-ingest skill's LLM layer enhances extraction when running in an LLM context.
- Heading number stripping: leading `N. ` / `N- ` prefixes removed from entity names before slugging (prevents `1-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- LLM re-ranking on recall: haiku model, Tier 1 only, 3s hard timeout, `RECALL_RERANK_ENABLED` env var kill switch
- All hooks are non-blocking (try/except wrapped) — compilation failure never breaks reflection/synthesis
- Dedup: same source can't add to a concept page twice. Different sources accumulate sections.
- Raw source preservation: `/vault-ingest` Step 2.5 copies original to `raw/` (immutable) before compilation
- Lint strips code blocks before wikilink scanning — template `[[Link-1]]` examples in SCHEMA.md won't trigger false positives
- Auto-generated files (daily logs, BUILD-LOG.md, team plans) excluded from frontmatter validation
- Connection articles include `date:` field in frontmatter (auto-generated)

### Daily Reflection (8 AM)

Reviews yesterday's daily log and promotes important items to MEMORY.md. After promotion, compiles entities from the reviewed daily log(s) into concept pages.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_reflect.py` | Main script — reviews logs, updates MEMORY.md |
| `run_reflect.bat/.sh` | OS scheduler wrappers |

**State:** `.claude/data/state/reflection-state.json`

### Weekly Synthesis (Sunday 8 PM)

Reviews 7 days of logs, creates `vault/memory/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md`, updates GOALS.md. After synthesis, compiles entities from the new weekly note into concept pages.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_weekly.py` | Main script — reviews 7 days, creates weekly summary |
| `run_weekly.bat/.sh` | OS scheduler wrappers |

```bash
uv run python memory_weekly.py              # Run weekly synthesis
uv run python memory_weekly.py --test       # Dry run
uv run python memory_weekly.py --days 14    # Two-week lookback
```

| | Daily Reflection | Weekly Synthesis |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule | Daily 8 AM | Sunday 8 PM |
| Lookback | 1 day | 7 days |
| Output | Updates MEMORY.md | Creates `weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` + updates MEMORY.md + GOALS.md |
| Max chars | 20,000 | 60,000 |
| Max turns | 20 | 30 |

**State:** `.claude/data/state/weekly-state.json`

### Dream Consolidation (Post-Weekly + Manual)

Deep memory consolidation — merges cross-session signal, prunes stale entries, normalizes dates, resolves contradictions. Runs as a post-step of weekly synthesis and is also callable standalone. Provider-agnostic via `run_with_fallback()`.

**4 Phases:**

| Phase | Type | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1. Orient | Pure Python | Reads MEMORY.md stats, lists recent logs, counts concepts |
| 2. Gather Signal | Pure Python | Regex grep for corrections, saves, stalls, repeated entities. Weighted scoring (threshold=4). If no signal → `DREAM_SILENT`, exits without LLM call |
| 3. Consolidate | LLM | Merges signal into MEMORY.md/SELF.md, normalizes dates, resolves contradictions |
| 4. Prune | LLM | Enforces 200-line limit, removes stale entries, verifies wikilink pointers |

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_dream.py` | Main script — 4-phase pipeline |
| `config.py` | `DREAM_STATE_FILE`, `DREAM_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS`, `DREAM_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD` |

```bash
uv run python memory_dream.py              # Run dream cycle
uv run python memory_dream.py --test       # Dry run (no file edits)
uv run python memory_dream.py --force      # Skip recency guard
uv run python memory_dream.py --days 14    # Scan 14 days of logs
```

**Key design decisions:**
- Phases 1-2 are zero-cost (pure Python grep) — LLM only invoked when signal found
- Weighted signal scoring: corrections=2, saves=2, stalls=1, repeated_entities=3. Threshold=4
- Crash-safe: state advanced before LLM phases. Failed runs (`result: "failed"`) bypass recency guard for immediate retry
- `post_weekly` flag warns LLM that weekly synthesis just ran (prevents duplication)
- Session flush files filtered by `mtime` (only recent files within `days` window)
- Hermes-inspired patterns: `[SILENT]` suppression, advance-before-execute, cross-platform file locking
- 18 tests (12 Phase 1-2 + 6 adversarial: happy path, failure retry, partial completion, post-weekly, threshold)

**State:** `.claude/data/state/dream-state.json`
**Trigger:** Post-step of weekly synthesis (Sunday 8 PM) + standalone CLI + `/vault-dream` skill (planned)

### Working Memory (Living Mind Phase 1)

Cross-session scratchpad — open threads, hypotheses, unresolved questions. Solves amnesia between sessions: a file-based curated middle tier between per-session continuity and long-term MEMORY.md. Gary Tan "LLM Memory Unsolved" thesis implementation.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `living_memory.py` | Read/write/age primitives — file_lock + atomic writes, regex section parsing, 3-day dedup, insert-only archive |
| `vault/memory/WORKING.md` | Canonical scratchpad (5 fixed sections: Open Threads, Active Hypotheses, Unresolved Questions, Heartbeat Observations [reserved], Archived (Cold)) |
| `runtime/bootstrap.py` | `_extract_working_memory()` — compact ~400-char briefing block between rules and active projects |
| `chat/engine.py` | `working_memory` frozen region (600-token budget, full content, after `durable_memory`) |
| `hooks/session-end-flush.py` | `append_open_threads_from_flush()` — 6 regex signals (TODO, waiting on, next up, need to verify, etc.), capped at 3/session, no LLM |
| `memory_dream.py` | Phase 2.5 — `archive_stale_working_items()` moves items >`WORKING_MEMORY_AGE_DAYS` (default 7) |

**Commands:**
- `/working` — show active sections (Open Threads / Hypotheses / Questions)
- `/working add "<text>"` — append to Open Threads with today's date
- `/working resolve <N>` — move item N (1-based) to Archived with `[resolved YYYY-MM-DD]` prefix

**Observability:** 3 Langfuse spans — `living_memory_read`, `living_memory_write`, `living_memory_archive`. Metadata includes `threads_count`, `bytes_read/written`, `archived_count`, `sections_touched`, `threads_skipped_dedup`. All spans fail-open (try/except wraps every Langfuse call).

**Key design decisions:**
- Insert-only archive — Gary Tan invariant, never hard-delete
- Zero LLM in hot path — regex + date math only, <50ms per operation
- Active section caps: Open Threads 10, others 5 (oldest age to archive when exceeded)
- 3-day dedup window via subject prefix match (40 chars, case-insensitive)
- Atomic writes via `tmp + os.replace()` under `shared.file_lock()` (cross-platform, 5s timeout)
- Frontmatter `date:` field refreshed on every write
- Non-goals: Phase 2 episodes/, Phase 3 heartbeat observation writes (section reserved empty), Phase 4 proactive brief generator

**Env vars:**
- `REGION_BUDGET_WORKING_MEMORY` (default 600) — token budget for the engine region
- `WORKING_MEMORY_AGE_DAYS` (default 7) — age threshold for dream cycle archival

**Tests:** 19 tests (13 behavior + 5 Langfuse spans + 1 resolve integration)
**Commit:** `1de11c0`
