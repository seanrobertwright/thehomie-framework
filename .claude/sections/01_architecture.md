### Vertical Slice Architecture

The Homie is one framework with two implementation surfaces:

- `thehomie` = runtime, memory, CLI, adapters, hooks, and cognition
- `mission-control` = official GUI / control-plane surface at `C:\Users\YourUser\mission-control`

Within that framework, behavior is organized as vertical slices. Group behavior by the owning surface and the owning slice instead of collapsing everything into one shared horizontal utility layer.

| Slice | Ownership |
|------|-----------|
| `.claude/chat/` | Operator interfaces, routing, session persistence, platform adapters |
| `.claude/scripts/runtime/` | Reasoning runtime boundary, provider selection, auth-profile resolution, fallback, Langfuse tracing |
| `.claude/hooks/` | Session lifecycle hooks and flush behavior |
| `.claude/scripts/` | Scheduled jobs, memory pipelines, orchestration scripts |
| `.claude/chat/cognition/` | Cognitive modules — recall, processes, regions, capture, promotion, graph, continuity, self-model |
| `.claude/scripts/orchestration/` | Convoy/mailbox service layer, executor adapters, local API (port 4322), contract |
| `.claude/scripts/integrations/` | Direct platform API integrations |
| `.claude/scripts/integrations/finance_*` | Personal finance: bank sync, budget queries, Teller/Plaid clients |
| `vault/memory/` | Canonical memory substrate |
| `C:\Users\YourUser\mission-control\src\app\api\` | Hub / Mission Control control-plane APIs |
| `C:\Users\YourUser\mission-control\src\components\` | Hub / Mission Control GUI panels and interaction surfaces |

Preferred change shape:

- extend the slice that owns the behavior
- preserve the runtime slice and GUI slice as separate implementation surfaces even when they serve the same product feature
- avoid bypassing slice ownership with ad hoc helpers in unrelated folders
- avoid creating cross-surface abstractions just because both repos touch the same feature
- avoid generic abstractions before a concrete second use exists
- if a change affects chat, runtime, and tests, land the whole vertical slice together

### Runtime And Auth Boundary

Reasoning execution now belongs behind `.claude/scripts/runtime/`, not in direct provider SDK calls spread across the codebase.

Current runtime/auth profile classes:

- `claude`: subscription-backed local Claude Code / Claude Agent SDK path
- `openai_codex`: subscription-backed ChatGPT / Codex path
- `openai-compatible`: API-key or gateway-backed path such as OpenAI API, OpenRouter, or compatible local endpoints

Important:

- `openai_codex` is not the same thing as `openai-compatible`
- provider identity and auth method are separate concerns
- voice STT/TTS stays separate from the main reasoning runtime
- business behavior and slash-command semantics must not depend on one vendor-specific auth path

### Framework vs. Adapter Boundary

The Homie is provider-agnostic. Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, OpenRouter — they're interchangeable batteries. The framework doesn't care which one is running.

This creates two layers with different rules:

| Layer | Examples | Design Rule |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Framework** | bootstrap.py, engine.py, recall, memory, cognition, adapters | Must work for ANY provider. No assumptions about provider-specific features (Read tool, CLAUDE.md, hooks). Self-contained. |
| **Adapter** | CLAUDE.md, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/settings.json`, MCP bridges | Provider-specific integration surface. Can assume provider capabilities. Not part of the framework. |

Key implications:

- `build_session_start_context()` in bootstrap.py is **framework-level** — its output is the AI's orientation regardless of provider. Design it to be self-contained, not reliant on CLAUDE.md being present.
- CLAUDE.md is **adapter-level** — it tells Claude Code CLI how the codebase works. It is NOT part of The Homie framework. When heartbeat/reflection/synthesis run through Codex or Gemini fallback, nothing from CLAUDE.md is needed or used.
- SOUL.md, SELF.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md are **framework identity** — they travel with the framework and must be injected by bootstrap.py for any provider.
- Don't optimize framework behavior around one provider's specific capabilities (e.g., "the AI can just Read the file" assumes Claude Code's Read tool).

### Canonical Memory Contract

The Obsidian vault remains the source of truth. `memory.db` and `chat.db` are derived state and caches.

Preserve these behaviors when changing execution:

- shared bootstrap context
- proactive recall
- session resume
- PreCompact / SessionEnd flush
- daily reflection
- weekly synthesis
- heartbeat
