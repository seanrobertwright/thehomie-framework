"""Reflection-time operator-belief extraction (Living Self Act 1, B2 + M2).

Forms operator beliefs from the operator's VERBATIM ``role == "user"`` words
(read from chat.db via ``session.read_operator_user_turns``) using a real LLM
claim-extraction step — NOT a regex/keyword filter (operator-forbidden band-aid)
and NOT the daily-log paraphrase (the bot's third-person restatement).

Hosted INSIDE the existing 8 AM daily reflection loop
(``memory_reflect._run_reflection_inner``): amortized once per reflection,
provider-agnostic (Claude -> Codex -> Gemini via ``cognition.steps.reasoning_step``),
never the chat hot path. The extractor emits the never-built ``reflection`` /
``explicit`` sources for ``self-model-inferences.json``.

Rule 1: knobs via ``get_inference_extraction_settings`` (call-time None-sentinel).
Rule 3: any Langfuse span via ``langfuse_setup.get_observation_client`` (module-
attribute lookup), fail-open None.
M2: tolerant JSON parse — unwrap the ``{"claims":[…]}`` provider-wrap before
filtering so Codex/Gemini variance doesn't silently yield zero claims.

    """Normalize a provider response into a list of claim objects (M2).

    ``reasoning_step`` returns ``result.parsed`` = ``_extract_json(text)`` which
    tolerates raw JSON and ```json fences. But Codex/Gemini frequently wrap a
    requested array as ``{"claims":[…]}`` / ``{"beliefs":[…]}`` even when asked
    for a bare array; the naive ``[c for c in parsed]`` would then iterate the
    DICT's KEYS (strings) and silently return zero dicts.

    - list -> passes through.
    - dict -> unwrap the first list under a known key (claims/beliefs/items/
      inferences/contradictions/conflicts), or, failing that, the SOLE
      list-valued field.
    - anything else (None / garbage / a dict with no usable list) -> ``[]``
      (fail-open: zero claims, never crash, never ingest garbage).

    Act 2 (M2): the key tuple is EXTENDED with ``contradictions``/``conflicts``
    so the belief-contradiction judge's wrap unwraps via a known key, NOT the
    fragile sole-list fallback. A multi-list wrap from Codex/Gemini like
    ``{"conflicts":[…], "reasoning":["because"]}`` (TWO list-valued keys) would
    otherwise hit ``len(lists) != 1`` and silently return ``[]`` — the
    silent-failure signature this project has been burned by. The extension only
    ADDS keys (harmless to Act-1 extraction: a ``claims`` response never carries
    the new keys, and the branch test's two-unknown-list case stays ``[]``).

    gate. Each malformed claim is skipped, not fatal.

    moved by the OPT-IN write-time contradiction step (WS3 #84). The caller uses

    nightly judge/policy). On a dedup HIT (the returned record's id was already in
