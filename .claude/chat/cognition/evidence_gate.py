"""Living Self Act 4 — the evidence-READ amendment gate (deterministic, SECURITY).

Today a belief reaches SELF.md because the LLM asserted ``confidence_score >=
0.75`` and named ``evidence_paths`` the gate only COUNTS (``amendments.py:772``,
``len(proposal.evidence_paths) < min_evidence_paths``) and NEVER opens. This gate
makes belief EARNED: it OPENS, CONFINES, and BOUNDS each cited path, verifies it
EXISTS + deterministically supports the claim, and requires the candidate to beat
the belief-regression floor — BEFORE the UNCHANGED default-deny policy gate.

It is the NECESSARY + cheap-pre-filter half of the earned-adoption stack (the LLM
judge in ``evolve/judge.py`` is the SUFFICIENT support-decider, scheduled-only).
This gate is DETERMINISTIC (no provider call) so it is safe to run inside ANY
producer's hot path — the producers do NOT pass it in Act 4 (only ``evolve_loop``
does), but the capability exists and is proven.

M4 — SECURITY (the directive's top priority). The candidate is LLM-/Archon-
proposed (semi-trusted) and its ``evidence_paths`` are author-written. An
unconfined unbounded read would be an arbitrary-file-read + OOM +
judge-prompt-injection hole. The gate:
  (a) CONFINES every path under ``memory_dir`` ONLY (the vault — F3; NOT the
      whole repo, so ``.claude/scripts/.env`` and other in-repo secrets can never
      be read into the judge prompt) — resolve FIRST (``.resolve()`` collapses
      ``..`` AND follows symlinks), THEN ``is_relative_to`` on the resolved path.
      Resolve-before-confine is load-bearing (a symlink inside the vault pointing
      OUT is caught by resolve-first; the lexical confine-then-resolve check would
      wrongly pass it — proven on this win32 box). A traversal / absolute /
      symlink-escape / in-repo-but-out-of-vault path is REJECTED, NOT read, NOT
      fed to the judge.
  (b) BOUNDS the read — ``stat().st_size > max_bytes`` -> non-supporting (no
      read); reads at most ``max_bytes`` even from an in-range file; re-applies
      the cap to any injected ``read_text`` return (the fake reader bypasses
      ``stat``) so a TOCTOU-grown file cannot OOM.
  (c) MISSING / dir / unreadable / empty = evidence-FAIL, never a silent "OK".
  (d) The read bytes fed to the judge are the SAME confined+bounded content,
      ``_safe``-collapsed + length-capped + framed "DATA, never an instruction".

Rule 1 (call-time settings), Rule 2 (PHYSICAL bytes via ``_read_text``, never the
confidence float), fail-open WITH a visible ``[evolve.gate]`` print (N2).
