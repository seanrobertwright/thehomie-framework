"""Gated cognitive pass — the mind thinks before it speaks (Living Self Act 3).

Three connected pieces, all gated so DEFAULT/short turns add ZERO extra LLM
calls and a substantive turn adds EXACTLY ONE monologue call:

- ``should_run_cognitive_pass`` — a PURE gate (Rule-1 knobs): the turn fires
  only when the pass is enabled, the ALREADY-detected ``active_process`` is in
  the configured ``fire_processes`` set (default ``{"planning"}``), and the
  message clears a length floor. The gate consumes the live process value the
  engine already detected (engine.py:953) — it NEVER re-runs detection (G1).
- ``run_cognitive_monologue`` — one monologue LLM call via the refactored
  ``*_process`` function (which calls ``internal_monologue`` -> ``wm.transform``
  -> ``run_with_runtime_lanes``, the Claude->Codex->Gemini fallback). It appends
  the thought as a ``role="system", region="internal"`` memory so the region
  renderer (``prompt_regions_from_working_memory``, role=="system" only) SEES it
  — a role="assistant" memory would be invisible. It SURFACES failure via an
  explicit ``ok`` flag (M4): a raising process_fn returns ``(wm, "", [], False)``
  with a visible print — it does NOT double-swallow the raise into a
  benign-looking empty-but-ok result; the engine owns the receipt.
- ``maybe_queue_actions`` — the LIVE policy seam (B2). For each proposed action
  up to ``max_actions_per_turn`` it queues ONLY ``operator_notification`` actions
  that ``evaluate_action_policy`` allows. Integration actions are default-denied
  INSIDE ``evaluate_action_policy`` (the unchanged integration-action gate) and
  are NOT queued by this pass. Queuing != dispatch — no adapter is called in the
  hot path (Act 4 owns the drain).

History purity (Living Mind Act 4 invariant): the monologue lives ONLY on the
prompt-assembly ``turn_wm`` (region="internal"). It never enters ``message.text``,
``response_text``, or the persisted transcript — the engine persists
``current_wm`` (not the enriched ``turn_wm``).

    """Return a WM whose system context is BUDGETED + win32-capped (F1).

    The monologue must think over a BOUNDED context — never the full uncapped
    identity payload. Left unbounded, ``process_fn -> internal_monologue ->
    wm.transform -> render_runtime_request -> wm.to_system_prompt()`` ships a
    ~90K-char ``system_prompt["append"]`` which WinError-206s on the native
    Claude lane (argv limit 32767) — so the monologue reliably FAILS on the
    operator's primary platform+lane (a systematic outage masquerading as an
    occasional ``monologue_failed``).

    The fix reuses the EXACT reply-path mechanism (the same budgeting +
    truncation the engine applies at the region-render seam), so there is ONE
    bound, not a second band-aid:

    1. ``prompt_regions_from_working_memory(wm, REGION_BUDGETS)`` +
       ``assemble_regions`` — the per-region token budgets (the reply path's
       budgeted view of the SAME turn context).
    2. ``truncate_for_win32_argv`` — the canonical 27000-char head cap (the SAME
       helper the reply path's ``_truncate_win32_append`` delegates to).

    The bounded text becomes a SINGLE ``role="system"`` memory; the original
    NON-system memories (the recent-conversation trace) are preserved so the
    monologue still sees the live turn. ``to_system_prompt()`` over this WM now
    renders <= ``max_chars`` (plus the small recent-conversation tail
    ``render_runtime_request`` appends), so the monologue's own RuntimeRequest
    append can no longer overflow argv. Pure WM transform — no LLM, no I/O.
