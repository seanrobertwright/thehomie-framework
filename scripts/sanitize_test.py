# === PRD-8 Phase 7a (WS1) — SECRET_PREFIXES regression tests ===
#
# R1 B1 + M2 fix — uses the canonical `contains_leak_pattern` helper from
# security.patterns (NOT a private `_contains_leak_pattern`). One test per
# SECRET_PREFIXES entry verifies LEAK_PATTERN_REGEX catches the synthetic
# key. Synthetic — NEVER a real key (24-char `x` tail).
#
# R1 M3 negative tests — UUIDs, git SHAs, short labels, JSON field names
# must NOT match LEAK_PATTERN_REGEX (defense against false-positive
# redaction in vault notes / commit messages / config).
