# The Homie Manual

This is the canonical feature manual for The Homie.

Use this when you need to understand what has shipped, where the source of
truth lives, how to operate a feature, how to test it, and which proof/handoff
documents back the current state.

`docs/manual/` is public-framework documentation. Keep it portable and
sanitizer-safe; private handoffs, PRPs, vault notes, account details, and
machine-specific proof artifacts stay outside the public manual.

## Open Source Reader Path

1. Start with the root [README](../../README.md) for Quick Install, Getting
   Started commands, the documentation map, and proof boundaries.
2. Use [INSTALL](../../INSTALL.md) for setup and channel credentials.
3. Read [Operating Room](features/operating-room.md),
   [Capability Gateway](features/capability-gateway.md), and
   [Desktop v0](features/desktop-v0.md) to understand the current dashboard
   and desktop operator loop.
4. Read [Multi-Channel Adapters](features/multi-channel-adapters.md) for
   Telegram attachments, attachment groups, quick-turn batching, and
   Queue/Steer follow-up controls.
5. Read [Runtime Status And Model Control](features/runtime-status-model-control.md)
   before changing provider, lane, or quiet JSON behavior.

## Ecosystem Positioning

The Homie sits in the same public agent ecosystem as OpenClaw and Hermes Agent.
OpenClaw proved broad agent/channel access; Hermes pushed self-improving loops
and desktop/operator ergonomics. The Homie is independent and identity-first:
durable memory, judgment, Operating Room orchestration, and thin
channel/desktop surfaces over one runtime. Use [NOTICE](../../NOTICE.md) and
[AUTHORS](../../AUTHORS.md) for attribution; use
[CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for community participation.

Private proof handoffs, tracker entries, and migration notes stay out of the
public framework export. Feature pages summarize the latest proof without
requiring those private documents.

## Public Proof Boundaries

- Desktop v0 proves the dashboard-first Electron app and unpacked Windows package. A signed
  installer or no-admin installer flow is not claimed yet.
- Cabinet Voice has lifecycle controls and a partial LiveKit spike. The
  browser mic -> transcript -> Cabinet reply path remains deferred.
- Local proof reports, private handoffs, account-specific setup, and generated
  runtime artifacts stay private even when the feature manual is public.

## Manual Maintenance Rules

When a feature ships or materially changes:

1. Update or create the matching page under `docs/manual/features/`.
2. Add it to the Active Feature Manuals table if it is new.
3. Keep private agent instructions slim; add only pointers or invariants that
   all agents need.
4. Keep `PRPs/active/TRACKER.md` focused on current state and next work, not a
   full feature manual.
5. Link proof handoffs from the feature page instead of copying whole handoffs.
6. Do not paste secrets, account IDs, token values, cookies, raw browser state,
   private phone/email details, or unredacted local env values.
7. If a feature is public-framework safe, say whether it has been exported.
   Public export still goes through `scripts/sanitize.py`; never manually copy.

## Feature Coverage Map

This first manual pass intentionally seeds the highest-churn Homie features.
Remaining features should be folded in during follow-up passes:

- Mission Control relay surfaces

Use the template, tracker, handoffs, recent commits, and targeted vault context
when adding those pages.
