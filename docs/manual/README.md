# The Homie Manual

This is the canonical feature manual for The Homie.

Use this when you need to understand what has shipped, where the source of
truth lives, how to operate a feature, how to test it, and which proof/handoff
documents back the current state.

`docs/manual/` is public-framework documentation. Keep it portable and
sanitizer-safe; private handoffs, PRPs, vault notes, account details, and
machine-specific proof artifacts stay outside the public manual.

Private proof handoffs, tracker entries, and migration notes stay out of the
public framework export. Feature pages summarize the latest proof without
requiring those private documents.

## Manual Maintenance Rules

When a feature ships or materially changes:

1. Update or create the matching page under `docs/manual/features/`.
2. Add it to the Active Feature Manuals table if it is new.
3. Keep `AGENTS.md` slim; add only a pointer or invariant that all agents need.
4. Keep `PRPs/active/TRACKER.md` focused on current state and next work, not a
   full feature manual.
5. Link proof handoffs from the feature page instead of copying whole handoffs.
6. Do not paste secrets, account IDs, token values, cookies, raw browser state,
   private phone/email details, or unredacted local env values.
7. If a feature is public-framework safe, say whether it has been exported.
   Public export still goes through `scripts/sanitize.py`; never manually copy.

## Feature Coverage Map

This first manual pass intentionally seeds the highest-churn Homie features.
Remaining features should be folded in during follow-up passes:

- Multi-channel adapters and Mission Control relay surfaces

Use the template, tracker, handoffs, recent commits, and targeted vault context
when adding those pages.
